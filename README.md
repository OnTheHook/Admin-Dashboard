# admin-dashboard
This is a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) HTML course.
In this project we were asked to create a dashboard based on the images below.

The main objective of this project is to get comfortable using CSS Grid and other layout tools.
I made a spin on the design by creating a social network for people who are not very social called AntiSocial.
